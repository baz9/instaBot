# instaBot
An instagram bot written in Python that uses selenium and firefox to generate traffic.

After trying to find an instagram bot that would successfully generate likes/views/follows to an account I decided to build my own.

The bot has been tested over a 3 month period to the point where it will now run uninterrupted for an extended period of time.
Despite this, I still advise the bot should be ran for short periods of time.
The bot has various random sleep timers which are used to look less robotic.
This current build is the one in which the bot seems to run the longest without being stopped.
The amount of likes can be adjusted in order to give a more even distribution of likes on tags.
I have found that with a large amount of likes the bot will eventually be noticed by instagram.
The bot will then log out of the current cycle, log in to the account again and move onto the next hashtag in the list.

This bot has generated between 15-30 follows a day when running but this is obviously dependant on tags and the page you are driving traffic to.
